# SOLID

+ Shapes example to illustrate the use of the above principles.

+ **S** - Single Responsibility as shown by `Rectangle` and `getAreaOfRectangles`.
+ **O** - Open/Closed principle - "Open" for extension/ "Closed" for modification.
  Existing `AreaCalculator` would need to be modified to incorporate new shapes.
